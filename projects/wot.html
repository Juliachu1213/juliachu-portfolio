      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This thesis addresses the limitations of the traditional CWMP (CPE WAN Management Protocol) used in smart home gateways,
        which suffers from SOAP overhead, inefficient event notifications, and weak security mechanisms.
      </p>
      <p>
        By introducing the Web of Things (WoT) architecture, the research redefines CWMP’s SOAP-based RPC methods into RESTful APIs,
        improving interoperability and system modularity. Furthermore, WebSocket and Webhook are implemented to replace the CWMP Inform mechanism,
        significantly enhancing real-time event communication.
      </p>

      <h2>Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Enhance interoperability through RESTful API-based method mapping following WoT standards.</li>
        <li>Improve event notification performance via WebSocket and Webhook.</li>
        <li>Strengthen authentication and authorization using OAuth 2.0 and JWT.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>System Design & Implementation</h2>
      <p>
        The proposed WoT–CWMP architecture integrates multiple key technologies:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Thing Description (TD):</strong> Defines device and service resources in JSON-LD format for unified access.</li>
        <li><strong>OAuth 2.0 & JWT:</strong> Enables secure user authentication and resource authorization.</li>
        <li><strong>Database Layer (PostgreSQL):</strong> Stores device configurations, client credentials, and event logs.</li>
        <li><strong>Spring Boot Framework:</strong> Implements WoT scripting logic in Java, re-architecting the CWMP workflow.</li>
        <li><strong>API Testing:</strong> Conducted using Postman with GitHub OAuth integration for validation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Experiment & Results</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>30% reduction in event notification latency using WebSocket/Webhook.</li>
        <li>Higher stability under 5,000+ concurrent requests through load testing.</li>
        <li>Improved maintainability and scalability from modular RESTful interfaces.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        This thesis proposes a secure and efficient smart home gateway management system based on the Web of Things framework.
        By integrating RESTful APIs, OAuth 2.0, and JWT, the system achieves better interoperability, reduced latency, and stronger security,
        providing a feasible reference model for next-generation IoT gateway architectures.
